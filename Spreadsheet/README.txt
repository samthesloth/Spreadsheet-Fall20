Program made by Sam Peters

About the Program:
This spreadsheet application allows the user to change contents of different cells, accepting numbers, strings, and formulas
in order to increase usability. The spreadsheet is made in a sleek black color with white forecolor to relieve stress on the eyes
while still popping out to the user. Selecting and manuevering the spreadsheet is easy, with controls for clicking cells and moving
with the arrow keys. Some extra features were added in order to increase effieciency and readability, such as ctrl functions and
tooltips on the content and formula boxes. A background worker has alos been implemented in order to increase the speed of calculations.
